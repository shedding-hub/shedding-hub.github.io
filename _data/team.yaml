    I develop affordable, equitable public health monitoring solutions that impose a minimal burden on the population. My research connects models with complex, often messy real-world datasets, such as data not originally intended for research purposes. I am particularly interested in open and reproducible science based on data that adheres to the principle of privacy by designâ€”without compromising the insights we can glean.

    Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics), Staff Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com), and Principal Research Scientist at [Sonalytic](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/spotify-acquires-audio-detection-startup-sonalytic/). I received my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of [Nick S. Jones](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones) and Master of Physics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk).

    My research interests span the areas of exposure assessment, wastewater surveillance, and infectious disease transmission. A common thread in his research is in understanding the human-environment interface with respect to infectious diseases. I design, develop, and evaluate statistical and mathematical models to support evidence-informed public health decision-making in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and in the United States.

    I am an Investigator of the [Emory Center for Infectious Disease Modeling & Analytics and Training Hub (CIDMATH)](https://cidmath.org/) and a Core Investigator at the [Center for Global Safe Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (CGSW)](https://www.cgswash.org/).
